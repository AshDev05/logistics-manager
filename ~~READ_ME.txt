-- WELCOME TO LOGISTICS MANAGER --

In this game, your goal is to manage the biggest and greatest logistics department of all times! As of {v.0.0.3a}, Nearly all essential functionalities have been implemented (see Changelog.txt).

-- HOW IT WORKS -- ~as of v.0.0.3a-m1~

To start the game, if you are on windows use 'launcher_win.bat' and enjoy! If you run Linux, execute 'sudo apt install idle', then launch 'launcher_linux.sh'. If you haven't configured your USB to be able to run files, copy the game to your local disk and launch the script. Alternatively, you can run '00_SHELL.py' in any interpreter (You can use idle in terminal by executing 'idle -r ./00_SHELL.py' while in game directory)
From there, you will be presented by the welcome sentence. Run 'new_game()' to create a game save, or run 'load_game()' to load an existing game.
A small tutorial exists if you run 'a.__tutorial__()' to get you into the game.

-- SAVING --

Saving was implemented in version 0.0.1a-f1
To save a game, use save()
	>>> save()
Note. Quitting a game (ref. tutorial) saves automatically.

Loading has also been implemented in version 0.0.1a-f1
To load an existing saved game, use load_game() function and follow the instructions.

-- FILE PROTECTION -- ALPHA USERS ONLY NOTICE

As of v0.0.3a, the file protection hasn't been implemented. Dev is looking for a way of protecting the save files during the entire process of playing. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE '*.lms' FILES WHILE PLAYING!!


-- CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER --

In this game, you have to play chronologically. First you import, then you produce, then you export. You can also mass import, then produce and export as needed. On a side note, the shop (v0.0.2a and up) is only available from level 2 and up. BEWARE, prices are high but realistic.
