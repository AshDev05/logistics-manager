## Documentation

### -- HOW IT WORKS --

To start the game, if you are on windows use 'launcher_win.bat' and enjoy! If you run Linux, install IDLE (sudo apt install idle / sudo pacman -S idle / etc...), then launch 'launcher_linux.sh'. If you haven't configured your USB to be able to run files, copy the game to your local disk and launch the script. Alternatively, you can run '00_SHELL.py' in any interpreter (You can use idle in terminal by executing 'idle -r ./00_SHELL.py' while in game directory)
From there, you will be presented by the welcome sentence. Run 'new_game()' to create a game save, or run 'load_game()' to load an existing game.\
A small tutorial exists if you run 'tutorial()' to get you into the game.

### -- SAVING --

Saving was implemented in version 0.0.1a-f1\
To save a game, use save()\
    >>> save()\
Note. Quitting a game saves automatically.

Loading has also been implemented in version 0.0.1a-f1
To load an existing saved game, use load_game() function and follow the instructions.

### -- FILE PROTECTION -- ALPHA USERS ONLY NOTICE

As of v.0.0.5a, the file protection hasn't been implemented. Dev is looking for a way of protecting the save files during the entire process of playing. Support will not be provided in case a file has been deleted.


### -- CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER --

In this game, you have to play chronologically. First you import, then you produce, then you export. You can also mass import, then produce and export as needed. On a side note, the shop (v0.0.2a and up) is only available from level 2 and up. BEWARE, prices are high but realistic.
